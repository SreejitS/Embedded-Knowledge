#### Access Levels
- There is a bit in CONTROL register, which indicates the access level.
- By making a bit in the special register CONTROL to 1 we make it unprivileged. The default is privileged(0 value).
- Unprivileged mode is there so that user tasks do not modify settings of kernel/OS code. Before handing the control to the user task, the kernel will change the access mode to that of unprivileged. If it wants to access low level things then it should do it using a system call that in turn will be services by the kernel. This is how a secure and robust system is built. 
- In order to change it back to privileged access level, we have to make the processor in handler mode, where the access is granted to modify the CONTROL register.
- *Question - how to generate interrupt from unprivileged thread mode of the processor in order to switch back to privileged access level?*
