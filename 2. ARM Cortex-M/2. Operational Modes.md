#### Operational modes of Cortex Mx Processors
- Applies to mainly M0/M3/M4
- There are 2 operational modes
	- Thread Mode: All the application code executes under this mode, also known as User mode. 
	- Handler Mode: All the exception handler or interrupt handler run under this mode. ISR is executed in this mode. [[16. Interrupts Part-1|Interrupts]]
- By default, processor starts with thread mode and when system exception or external interrupts occur, then it changes the mode to handler mode in order to service the ISR associated with it.
- Handler mode code always runs in [[2. Operational Modes#Access Levels|privileged access level]] and is allowed to read/modify any registers in processor and has full access to processor. We can limit thread mode code to run in unprivileged access level and restrict access to system registers. By default thread mode runs in privileged access level.
- Status register, IPSR(*Interrupt Program Status Register*) indicates if the processor is in thread or handler mode. 0 means thread mode and non-zero indicates the ISR number.

#### Access Levels
- Two access levels
	- Privileged - Full access to all the processor specific resources and restricted registers. This is the default mode. Handler mode always has this access level.
	- Unprivileged - May not have access to some of the restricted registers. When in thread mode, the access level can be changed to unprivileged using CONTROL register. Once the access level is set to unprivileged, then it cannot be moved back to privileged unless in handler mode, from where the CONTROL register is accessible.

#### Core Registers

- These reside inside the [[1. Introduction#Processor core vs Processor|processor core]]. 
	- R0-R12 are general purpose, can be used for data operation/manipulation, to store data and addresses. 32-bit wide
	- R13 [[8. Functions and Stack|SP]] Stack Pointer, used to track the stack memory
	- R14 LR Link Register, used to store return information for subroutines, function calls and exception. On reset, LR=0xFFFFFFFF.
	- R15 PC Program Counter contains the address of the instruction to be executed. On reset, processor loads PC with the reset vector, which is stored at `0x00000004`

- There are 5 special purpose registers
	- Program Status Register, PSR, hold the status of the execution state of the processor and is the combination of the following and is interpreted according to the state of the processor
		- APSR Application PSR, conditional flags for ALU, N/C/Z/V/Q/GE i.e. Negative/Carry/Zero/Overflow/DSP overflow-saturation flag/Greater Than or Equals
		- IPSR Interrupt PSR, contains exception number of the current ISR
		- EPSR Execution PSR, has the T-bit, thumb state bit.  T-bit is always 1 in cortex M processors and will result in Usage Fault otherwise. The LSB i.e. bit 0 of PC is linked with this T-bit. So when loading address(example vector table, function pointers using raw addresses) into PC, the address should always be odd. Generally taken care by the compilers. That's why vector addresses have its LSB set to 1.
			- If T-bit is 1 then processor thinks the next instruction is from Thumb Instruction Set 
			- If T-bit is 0, the processor thinks the next instruction is from ARM instruction set.

#### Notes
- Non memory mapped vs Memory mapped register
	- These registers do not have unique address to access them and are not part of the processor's memory map. We cannot access them in a C program using [[3. Variables and Pointers|de-referencing]]. To access them, we have to use assembly language. For writing assembly code in C, we have to use non-standard compiler extension.
	- Registers of the processor specific peripherals like NVIC,MPU etc. and registers of Microcontroller specific peripheral like I2C,SPI etc. has its own address and can be read/written using pointers in C language
