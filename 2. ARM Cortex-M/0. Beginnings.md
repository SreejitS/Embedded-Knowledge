## Motivations
Focus on how to transition from miro samek C course to this and re-use most of the mental models that we have created there.
- Cortex M processors are RTOS friendly due to different exceptions, processor operational modes and access level configuration provided by it which helps in designing secure RTOS apps
- It executes Thumb-2 instruction set which are memory efficient as most of it are 16-bit instructions and some 32-bit ones. It cannot execute ARM instruction set, which are 32-bit instructions.
