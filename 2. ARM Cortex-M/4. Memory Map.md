#### Memory Map
- Addressable memory location range depends on the size of the address bus. A 2-bit bus can access 4 different memory locations. A 32-bit wide processor can access 4GiB(0x0000 0000 to 0xFFFF FFFF) of unique addresses. This is the total address space of the processor.
- The processor can produce any address in this range on the address bus and the data on that address appears on the data bus.
	- For example, if the processor wants to read the value of an ADC register and store in the data memory. For this, it generates the address of the ADC register on the address bus and reads the content on the data bus and stores in the processor register. Then, it produces the address location inside the data memory and places the data on the data bus, transferring the value to the memory.

- This address space is divided into different sections according to the processor designers. This is fixed and the microcontroller vendor is expected to design with this in mind. The code memory(Flash, OTP, EEPROM etc.) must be connected within the 512MB address range as the processor expects the code in code section. The mapping of different regions is called the memory map.

#### Sections in detail
- Code Region `0x0000 0000` to `0x1FFF FFFF` i.e. 512MB
	- MCU vendor should connect code memory like Embedded Flash, ROM, OTP, EEPROM
	- Processor by default fetches vector table from this region
- Data Region  `0x2000 0000` to `0x3FFF FFFF` i.e. 512MB
	- This is mostly for connecting the on-chip SRAM for read/writable copy of data
	- The first 1MB is bit addressable
	- We can execute program code from this region
- Peripheral Region  `0x4000 0000` to `0x5FFF FFFF` i.e. 512MB
	- This is for MCU specific on-chip peripherals like ADC.RTC etc
	- First 1MB is bit addressable
	- This is an execute never region and will result in fault exception. This is to prevent code injection attacks
- External RAM Region  `0x6000 0000` to `0x9FFF FFFF` i.e. 1GB
	- This is mostly for off-chip memory like SDRAM
	- We can execute code from this region
- External Device Region `0xA000 0000` to `0xDFFF FFFF` i.e. 1GB
	- This is for external devices and/or shared memory
	- This is a execute never region
- Private Peripheral Bus Region `0xE000 0000` to `0xE00F FFFF` 
	- This is for processor specific peripherals
	- Divided into internal(ITM, SCS, DWT etc) and external(ETM,TPIU)
	- This is a execute never region


#### Bus Protocols and Bus Interfaces
- They are based on advanced microcontroller bus architecture(AMBA), designed by ARM and governs the on chip communication inside system on chip
- AMBA supports different bus protocols
	- AHB Lite(AMBA High Performance): Used for the main bus. Used by high speed peripherals
	- APB(AMBA Peripheral Bus): Used of Private Peripheral Access and on-chip peripheral using AHP-APB bridge. Used by low speed peripheral
- For Cortex M processors, there are 4 AHB buses, I-Code for Instructions, D-code for Data, S-bus for system bus and PPB for private peripherals.
- One example design is shown below
- ![[bus.JPG]]
- Here there is an bus arbiter, which manages the master and slave. For example, at a given point in time, the processor or DMA or Ethernet or USB OTG could be the master of the bus. The flash is connected to processor via I-bus and D-bus. Peripherals like ETM, NVIC is connected via PPB. On-chip peripherals are connected via APB-AHB bridge and here there are two such buses with different speed to manage power consumption.
- GPIO ports communicates to processor over AHB1 bus. Example data path - Any sensor connected to I2C1 is carried over APB1 bus, then goes to the AHB-APB bridge, where it is converted to AHB signals and is carried over the main AHB1 bus, then passes through the bus matrix arbiter and connects to the processor over S-bus

#### Bit-banding
- capability to address a single bit of memory address. So in the bit-banded region, each bit and combinations of them are given a unique address, making the memory region bit-addressable. Generally any memory locations are byte or half-word or word addressable. The traditional way to access a bit is to read the byte and mask out the particular bit that we want
- In cortex M, the initial 1MB of SRAM and peripherals regions have bit banded memory locations. These have 32MB alias addresses for each bit. So, we can access the bit band region using the bit banded alias address.
- When we use alias address, those operations are atomic.
