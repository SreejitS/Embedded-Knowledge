## Introduction

- Best way to understand the processor is the technical reference manual.

#### Processor core vs Processor
- Generally any processor consists of single core or multiple cores which are surrounded by many CPU specific peripherals
- Cortex M4 processor = Cortex M4 core + Processor specific peripherals
	- **Cortex M4 processor**
		- Its the basic computational engine of the processor and has its own register sets to manipulate data
		- It consists of ALU where the computation takes place
		- Barrel shifter
		- It has the [[2. Flow of Control|pipeline engine]] to boost the instruction execution. This increases the execution throughput.
		- It has the special function registers to track the execution state of the core
		- It has the instruction decoder to decode the instruction, which it fetches from the program memory and also checks if it is an valid instruction or not.
		-  multiplication/division hardware + address generation unit.
	- **Processor specific peripherals** = NVIC, AHB, MPU, ITM, FPB, bus matrix etc.
- Cortex M4 processors talk to external world by using buses(Icode, Dcode, System bus interface).

- CPUs can have multiple cores, and hence multi-core processors. Cortex M4 is a single core processor

#### Processor vs Microcontroller
- Microcontroller manufacturers buy the core and the peripherals in software IP format and choose to keep/remove the processor specific peripheral when integrating with their controller design.
- The ARM CORTEX M4 block in the pic below is given by ARM and STM designs the peripherals around it which it interfaces using the I-bus, D-bus and S-bus.

- The processor core acts as an master and the other peripherals are the slaves. The meet at the I/D/S-interface.

#### `printf()`: How to see the messages without a display device connected?
- *This is valid for cortex M3 and above processors i.e. M3/M4/M7 and not for Cortex M0/M0+*
- `printf()` works over SWO(*Serial Wire Output*) of the SWD(*Serial Wire Debug*) interface of the cortex processor.

- We have a board, which contains the micro-controller, which has the processor. There is an debug interface on the board, through which the board communicates the debug info(write program to internal flash of the micro-controller, read various memory locations, make processor run/halt, add/remove breakpoints from the IDE) to the PC via USB.

- This `printf()` is enabled due to a processor specific peripheral call ITM(*Instrumentation Trace Macro-cell*).

![[itm_fifo.JPG]]
- ITM has an hardware FIFO in which the data is written using `printf()` and this FIFO is connected to the SWO Pin which comes out via SWD and connects to PC via USB to transfer the `printf()` data, which is captured by the debug software IDE.

- When `printf()` is compiled, it is linked with standard c library which implements the low level `__write()`. which re-directs back to our project under `syscalls.c`. Here we can redirect the data to LCD,UART or ITM. ITM has 32 channels for the FIFO. 
```
Note: When ITM is not available, for example in Cortex M0/M0+, we have to use semihosting which is enabled using OpenOCD(open on-chip debugger)
```

#### SWD
- The serial wire debug is a two wire protocol for accessing the ARM debug interface.
- It is part of ARM Debug Interface Specification v5 and is alternative to the traditional JTAG
- The physical layer consists of two line
	- SWDIO - Bidirectional data line over which the controller and PC communicate
	- SWCLK - Clock driven by the st-link(for ex.) circuitry
	- Optional Trace pin - SWO - over which Single Wire Viewing is enabled
- JTAG vs SWD
	- Traditional mechanism for debug connections for AMR 7/9 family. With Cortex M, ARM introduced SWD as an alternative. JTAG uses 4 pins vs 2 pins for SWD
