#### Exception Model
- There are two types of exceptions
	- Exceptions: Generated internally by the processor
	- Interrupts: They come from external world
- When the processor core meets with exception, it changes the [[2. Operational Modes#|operational mode]] to Handler mode.
- Cortex M processor core supports 15 system exceptions and 240 interrupts, so total 255 exceptions

#### System Exceptions
- There is room for 15 exceptions, but only 9 are implemented and 6 are reserved for future use.
- Exception number 1 is Reset Exception
- Exception number 16 is Interrupt 1 (IRQ1)

##### System Exceptions
*The first three are always enabled by default*
- `Reset` is invoked on power up or a warm reset(from button press). The exception model treats reset as a special form of exception. When reset is asserted, the operation of the processor stops, potentially at any point in an instruction. When reset is de-asserted, execution restarts from the address provided by the reset entry in the vector table. Execution restarts as privileged execution in Thread mode. Priority value = -3
- `Non Maskable Interrupt (NMI)` can be signaled by a peripheral or triggered by software. This is the highest priority exception other than reset. It is permanently enabled and has a fixed priority of -2. NMIs cannot be:
		- masked or prevented from activation by any other exception
		- preempted by any exception other than Reset.
-  `HardFault` is an exception that occurs because of an error during exception processing, or because an exception cannot be managed by any other exception mechanism. Hard Faults have a fixed priority of -1, meaning they have higher priority than any exception with configurable priority. They are enabled by default, but can be masked.

*The next three are optional and hard fault is triggered in place if not enabled using SHCHR registers inside SCB*
-  `MemManage` fault is an exception that occurs because of a memory protection related fault. The the fixed memory protection constraints determines this fault, for both instruction and data memory transactions. This fault is always used to abort instruction accesses to Execute Never(XN) memory regions. Useful in OS environment for securing kernel memory. This is disabled by default.
- `BusFault` is an exception that occurs because of a memory related fault for an instruction or data memory transaction. This might be from an error detected on a bus in the memory system. This is rare. This is disabled by default.
- `UsageFault` is an exception that occurs because of a fault related to instruction execution. This includes:
		- an undefined instruction
		- an illegal unaligned access
		- invalid state on instruction execution
		- an error on exception return.
	The following can cause a UsageFault when the core is configured to report them:
		- an unaligned address on word and halfword memory access
		- division by zero.
	 This is disabled by default.

*The last three exceptions are there to help with the design of embedded OS*
- `Supervisor call (SVC)` is an exception that is only triggered by the SVC instruction. In an OS environment, applications can use SVC instructions to access OS kernel functions and device drivers
- `PendSV` is an interrupt-driven request for system-level service. In an OS environment, use PendSV for context switching when no other exception is active. This  is disabled by default.
- `SysTick` exception is an exception the system timer generates when it reaches zero. Software can also generate a SysTick exception. In an OS environment, the processor can use this exception as system tick.

##### System Exception Control Register
- Processor specific peripherals are [[4. Memory Map#Sections in detail|memory mapped]] to PPB and accessed using dedicated bus. This region contains registers specific to processor peripherals like NVIC, FPU, MPU etc.
- System Control Block (SCB) provides system implementation information, and system control. This includes registers for configuration, control, and reporting of the system exceptions.
- When an exception is triggered, then the status of the fault is indicated in the corresponding fault status register, which is part of this block.
- Priorities can be configured using priority control registers. The interrupts itself are controlled using NVIC. SCB is more for the control and configuration of them.

- To enable different system exceptions, bits inside *System Handler Control and State Register* are set for each type of exceptions.

#### NVIC
- This is a dedicated processor peripheral, which controls the interrupt traffic coming to the processor
- This is used to configure the 240 external(to the processor) interrupts.
- We can enable/disable/pend various interrupts and read status of active/pending interrupts, configure priority and priority grouping of various interrupts.
	- To Enable Interrupt: NVIC_ISER0-NVIC-ISER7 registers, each enabling 32 interrupts. Writing 1 enables the particular interrupt line. Writing 0 has no effect. To disable the interrupt line use the next register.
	- To Disable Interrupt: NVIC_ICER0-NVIC_ICER7, each disabling 32 interrupts. Writing 1 disables the particular interrupt line. Writing 0 has no effect. 
	- To Pend Interrupt: NVIC_ISPR0-NVIC_ISPR7, each pending 32 interrupts i.e. the interrupt is waiting to be serviced by the processor. Writing 1 pends the particular interrupt line. Writing 0 has no effect.
	- To Clear Pending State of Interrupt: NVIC_ICPR0_NVIC_ICPR7: each removing pending state of 32 interrupts. Writing 1 removes pending state of an interrupt. Writing 0 has no effect.
	- To Check Active Interrupts: NVIC_IABR0-NVIC_IABR7: each indicating the active interrupt i.e. an interrupt that is being serviced by the processor but has not completed.
- "Nested" as it supports pre-empting of lower priority interrupt when a higher priority interrupt is received.
- The 240 IRQ lines are micro-controller vendor specific and is triggered by various on chip peripherals like SPI, GPIO, I2C, DMA, CAN etc.

##### General flow for configuring the NVIC
- Identify the IRQ number of the peripheral.
- Program the registers on the processor side to enable the IRQ(NVIC_ISER). By default IRQs have priority of 0, can be changed if needed.
- Program the registers on the peripheral side to generate interrupt when certain conditions are met, for eg. packet received in the USART peripheral buffer
- When interrupt is issued on the IRQ line, it will get pended in the pending register of the processor.
- Now, NVIC will run the associated interrupt handler if the priority of the new interrupt is higher than the currently executing interrupt handler(in this case the pending state is automatically cleared), or else is remains in the pending state.
- *Note: If the IRQ is not enabled on the processor side, the interrupt still gets pended in the pending register of NVIC  and triggers execution of the ISR when IRQ gets enabled and priority is higher than the currently active ISR*
- Good practice is to enable the IRQ at the last after configuring the priorities and pending state if needed.

##### Interrupt Priority Configuration
- For ARM cortex M processor, lesser value implies higher priority.
- If two interrupts hit the NVIC together, then the interrupt with higher priority is serviced first by the processor.
- The number of priority levels or values depend on the micro-controller vendor's implementation of the Interrupt Priority Register
- There are 60 interrupt priority registers i.e. NVIC_IPR0_NVIC_IPR59 which provided 8-bit priority fields for each of the 240 interrupts. Each register can configure priority for 4 interrupts.
- Now, in this 8-bit field, depending on the vendor, if 3 bits are implemented, then there are 8 priority levels. If 4 bits are implemented, then 16 priority levels.
- For configuring the priorities for system exception, use the SCB. For 15 exceptions, 3 are of fixed priority. So for remaining 12, as each register can handle 4 interrupts, we need 3 priority registers i.e. SHPR1-SHPR-3

##### Pre-empt priority and sub priority
- If an exception occurs with the same priority as the exception being handled, the handler is not preempted, irrespective of the exception number. However, the status of the new interrupt changes to pending.
- To increase priority control in systems with interrupts, the NVIC supports priority grouping. This divides each interrupt priority register entry into two fields:
	• an upper field that defines the group priority
	• a lower field that defines a sub-priority within the group.
- Only the group priority determines preemption of interrupt exceptions. When the processor is executing an interrupt exception handler, another interrupt with the same group priority as the interrupt being handled does not preempt the handler.
- If multiple pending interrupts have the same group priority, the sub-priority field determines the order in which they are processed. If multiple pending interrupts have the same group priority and sub-priority, the interrupt with the lowest IRQ number is processed first.
- Now depending on the vendor, not all 8-bits would have been implemented. 
- There is are 3 bits in a register *Application Interrupt and Reset Control Register*(AIRCR) in SCB which determines the position of the binary point that splits the priority fields into separate group priority and sub-priority fields

#### Interrupt behavior
![[single_pending_interrupt.JPG]]
- 1: Processor is in thread mode
- 2: Interrupt is asserted by the peripheral
- 3: Corresponding Pending Bit is set
- 4: Processor switches from thread mode to handler mode by stacking and vector fetch
- 5: When processor switches the mode, the interrupt active bit is set
- 6: When processor switches the mode, pending bit is cleared
- 7: After interrupt is serviced, interrupt exit happens i.e. unstacking and processor resumes the thread mode
- 8: Interrupt active bit is cleared 

### Exception Entry and Exit Sequences
##### Exception Entry
- Pending bit is set in the pending register of the NVIC
- Exception mechanism stores the EXC_RETURN value in LR *(rather than the traditional PC when calling a C function)*. This EXC_RETURN captures the operational mode, which stack is being used to store the state and FPU information.
- Stacking and Vector Fetch will happen simultaneously. Stacking means pushing the contents of the registers onto the stack. Vector fetch means fetching the address of the exception handler from the vector table
- Enter the handler and the active bit is set
- Pending status is cleared automatically
- Processor mode is changed to handler mode
- Handler code is getting executed now. MSP will be used for any stack operations inside the handler.

##### Exit Sequence
- In cortex M processors, the exception return mechanism is triggered using a special return address called EXC_RETURN.
- [[18. Interrupts Part-3#Note 2|EXC_RETURN]] is generated during exception entry and is stored in LR. The exception mechanism relies on this value to detect when the processor has completed an exception handler
- When EXC_RETURN is written to PC to triggers the exception return
	- EXC_RETURN holds information of the current state of the processor in terms of operational mode, the stack being used to store the state and the FPU info, so that exception mechanism knows, to which state to restore to, after the exception.
- The processor unstacks i.e. restores the contents of the register, because of which control reaches the instruction where the processor was interrupted, and the EXC_RETURN value is decoded by the exception mechanism to return it to thread/handler mode, to use PSP/MSP to retrieve the state and to restore FPU stack frame or not.
