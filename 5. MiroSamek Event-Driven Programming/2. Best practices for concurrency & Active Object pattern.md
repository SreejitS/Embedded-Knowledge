#### Moving Into Embedded Systems
##### General issues in RTOS code
- Thread synchronize their execution with various events by blocking and waiting in-line for a chosen event to occur.
- Blocked thread is unresponsive to any other events not explicitly waited for.
- Consequently, the main workaround for adding new events is to create more threads, because multiple threads can wait for multiple events in parallel. So, ever growing number of threads could become expensive and unmanageable
- More importantly, the new threads need access to the same data, peripherals as the existing threads and this leads to sharing of resources among threads.
- As context switching is based on the existing interrupt hardware of the processor, it is also inherits the  same issue i.e. race-conditions. 
- Now in order to prevent them we need to identify and prevent them using mutual exclusion mechanisms, which leads to more blocking and even more secondary implications
- All this immensely complicates any timing analysis and can lead to missed real-time deadlines, which can ultimately lead to the system failure.

##### Best practices
- *These are the best practices organized around the idea that to remove shared-state concurrency we need to prohibit shared data/resources among threads. And to avoid blocking(which is not possible 100, but we minimize it), we must implement some sort of asynchronous communications among threads, so that the sender of the event sends and move forward without blocking.*
- ***One***: Keep data isolated, private to a thread where possible: This really means that threads should avoid sharing of data or resources with other threads, which eliminates the "shared-state concurrency" node in the "perils of blocking" diagram. Without sharing, there is no need for mutual exclusion and the big part of the vicious circle is eliminated.
- ***Two***: Communicate among threads via asynchronous messages.: This best practice packs two important concepts: "messages" or "events" and "asynchronous communication". These are exactly the event-driven concepts. "Event objects", also called "messages", are packaged data specially designed for communication. They carry the information about what happened, Additionally, event objects can carry event parameters that pertain to the event.
	- "Asynchronous communication" means that senders of events only post the events to the recipients, but they don't wait in-line, meaning don't block, until the event is processed. So, the best practice number two is designed to eliminate the "synchronization by blocking" node from the "perils of blocking diagram".
- ***Three***: Organize your thread's work around a message pump references directly the event-driven concept of "event loop" also called "message pump". This best practice goes directly after the blocking node in the diagram.
	- Please note that the "blocking" node cannot be eliminated completely, at least not with a traditional RTOS, because as you remember, every RTOS thread must necessarily block somewhere in its "super-loop". But the best practice number three prescribes the only allowed structure of the "super-loop" as the "message pump", which restricts the blocking to only one specific place in the loop.

##### Active Objects
- All these best practices combined establish a design pattern, which is known as the "Active Object" pattern. It provides a layer on top of naked threads, which otherwise let's us to do troublesome things
- In this pattern, Active Objects, like any other objects, have private data. But each active object also has a private thread and a private event queue.
- The only way to interact with an active object is by posting events to its event queue. The posting is *asynchronous*, meaning that the event is only placed in the queue, but there is no waiting until the event is processed.
- The event processing happens in the event-loop running in the private thread of the active object. The processing might involve sending secondary events to other active objects or even to self.
