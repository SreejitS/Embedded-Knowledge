#### Introduction
- This programming paradigm became mainstream during the introduction of GUI and the personal computing revolution during the 1980's.
- We will focus on this new paradigm and how this will apply in embedded world.
- Traditionally in the command-line driven systems prior to GUI systems, the only input device is the keyboard and the only output device is the bottom of the screen. Consequently, the sequential programming paradigm was enough to handle these systems.
- When GUI was introduced, the fundamental structure changed and a paradigm shift was necessary to handle it. For handling keyboard, you would need to know where the output is being produced, and for the mouse you would need to know which object on screen it is pointing to.
- Hence, graphical user interface introduced new levels of complexity, which are not in the same ballpark as the command-line interface.
- The key insight that enabled a workable solution was the focus on the inputs, which are called *events* or *messages*, such as the key-presses, mouse moves, and the secondary inputs, from objects on the screen, like buttons, desktop icons, scroll bars, etc.
- The focus on events means that the events drive the software, not the other way around like it was in the sequentially coded command-line programs.

##### Event-Loop
- **Event Loop** *aka Message Loop or Message Pump* :  The event loop has a very specific structure, consisting of these properties:
- First, there is a call to some form of get message API, which blocks and waits for any sort of messages. The system records when any event occurs and places it in the message queue for the particular application
	- This is how event-loop solves the problem of waiting simultaneously for multiple events.
	- The first key property is that an event-loop uses special message objects to record all events potentially interesting to an application. These message objects serve only for communication and can be conveniently stored in the event queue and later retrieved for processing.
	- Because of the message queue, events can be delivered both when the loop is waiting for them and when the loop is busy processing previous events.
	- In any case, the event-driven system only records the event as a message and places it in the message queue, but does NOT wait for the actual processing of the event. This type of event delivery is called *asynchronous*, and means that event producer executes independently from the consumer of events.
- The second property of the event-loop is that the there is some sort of call that must necessarily complete and return to the event-loop before the loop gets around to the next event. This means that event processing proceeds in Run-to-Completion (RTC) steps that cannot be interrupted by processing of any other event.
- And the third key property of event-loop is that it makes calls to your application code i.e. the event handler provided by the user. This is different than RTOS, where we were calling the services of RTOS. This property of event-loop is called *inversion of control*. 
	- This is the key characteristic of all event-driven systems and is the essence of event-driven programming. The inversion of control is really what it means that ***events drive the application*** not the other way around.

##### Event Handler
- Regarding the second property above, the event handler is generally a virtual member function for the class of the specific application i.e. changes according to the object member it is initialized to due to polymorphism properties
- The event handler receives the message and usually implement the switch statement based on the kind of the message to process the signal. The status of processing is returned back to the event-loop, thus implementing a two way communication.
- There is a default case which uses the default handler to handler all the cases not implemented in the switch case, which can provide for all the default behaviors of the system.
	- A good way of thinking about this design is that it is layered in the order of hierarchy. At the lowest level of the hierarchy is your code. It has the first shot at every event. 
	- But when the code does not explicitly handle an event, it is not ignored, but rather it is passed on to the default handler, which is at the higher-level of hierarchy.
	- The other names of this hierarchical design are the "Ultimate Hook" and "Programming by Difference". These two names mean exactly the same thing, but emphasize the different aspects of it.
	- "Ultimate Hook" emphasizes the ease of attaching, or "hooking up", your code to every event.
	- "Programming by Difference" emphasizes the fact that you only need to explicitly program the *differences* from the default behavior.

##### OOP Perspective
- Specifically, with the OOP perspective you can view the design as a class hierarchy in which there is a base class with hundreds of virtual functions, one for each message signal. Then the specific applications are the subclasses/derived classes that override the selected virtual functions in their event handler. i.e. Polymorphic

##### Event Driven vs Sequential
- Generally Sequential programming and event-driven programming are two distinct paradigms that don't mix well â€“ so always keep them separate.
- We cannot use the traditional blocking delay in the event-driven code as it would block the event handler and prevents quick return to the event-loop. When the event-loop spins slowly, the messages accumulate and is processed suddenly when the blocking is finished. This makes the application jumpy and unresponsive.
- Another point regarding delay is, both the start of delay and end of delay must generate two different events that needs to be handled as to adhere to the Run-to-Completion semantics universally assumed in all event-driven systems.
- Conclusion
	- First, blocking clogs the event-loop and destroys the responsiveness of the program to all events, not just those that block for a while.
	- And second, it violates the Run-to-Completion semantics universally assumed in all event-driven systems.

#### Conclusion
- To be called "event-driven" a program must posses most of the characteristics listed in this chart. But perhaps the property that sets an event-driven program most apart from a sequential one is *NO-BLOCKING* inside the application-level code.
