## Lesson 12: Structures and CMSIS
- Built in data types, chars, uint32_t etc. are called scalar data(i.e. the data type contains only a single value) types.
- Arrays are for grouping data of the same type i.e. vector type.
- Structures are mechanism in C for grouping data of different types. Helps in treating group of related variables as a single unit rather than different entities. In embedded systems, they help in accessing the hardware in an elegant way.
- Ways of declaring structs

```C
/*
Keyword struct introduces a structure declaration.
Optional name, called the structure tag may follow the struct keyword.(Point in below declaration)
Variables enlisted between the braces are called members.(x and y in this example)
*/
struct Point {
	uint16_t x;
	uint8_t y;
};

```

```C
/*
A structure declaration can be immediately followed by a list of variables. So for example, you can define variables pa and pb, both being Points.
*/
struct Point {
	uint16_t x;
	uint8_t y;
}pa, pb;
```

```C
/*
Actually, if you define variables immediately after the structure, you might omit the structure tag altogether.
*/
struct {
	uint16_t x;
	uint8_t y;
}pa, pb;
```

```C
/*
More common is to define a structure followed with an empty list of variables
*/
struct Point {
	uint16_t x;
	uint8_t y;
};

/*
A structure declaration that is not followed by a list of variables reserves no storage, but if the structure is tagged, you can use it later to declare variables as follows.
*/
struct Point pa, pb;
```

```C
/*
To avoid repetition, we can typedef the struct Point type as Point, then use the Point type directly
The first Point word below is the struct tag and the second is the typedef name, both are in different namespaces. Tag names in C occupy a different namespace than
typedef names, variable names, or function names. 
*/
typedef struct Point Point;
Point pa, pb
```

```C
/*
To remove the repetition of the Point name altogether use the un-tagged struct declaration inside the typedef. Here the type 'Point' is being typedef'd rather that the 'struct Point' from the previous example
*/
typedef struct {
	uint16_t x;
	uint8_t y;
} Point;

Point pa, pb

/*
Actually, this is also recommended by the latest safety C standard called MISRA:C-2012, where the advisory rule 2.4 recommends that a project should not contain unused tag declarations.
*/
```

- Struct tag names are almost never needed, exception being the so called self-referential structures, such as nodes of linked lists or trees.


### Member order and Padding
- [Stackoverflow Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28928283/why-padding-are-added-if-char-comes-after-int)
- [alignment and padding (c-faq.com)](http://www.c-faq.com/struct/align.html)
- will pad if following member has a bigger alignment requirement or the last member is small, so the the variable after the struct is placed at an aligned address.
- `sizeof(pa)` will return 4 bytes.
- Compiler will the place the members in the memory exactly as you typed them in the structure declaration. 
- However, the compiler can and sometimes will insert extra padding bytes into your structure. Why? Cortex M processors are binary compatible with the upper ones in the same series. for Cortex M0, accessing half words at odd address need more instruction. The STRH instruction in Cortex-M0 is less powerful than in Cortex-M4 and cannot access a half-word allocated at an odd address. So, the compiler will generate the code in way such that the members are accessed in a single instruction, be it STRB for byte, STRH for half-byte etc.

![[arm_cm_instructions.png]]
- We can explicitly ask the compiler to not pad using the extended keyword packed, which is not the part of the standard C, but compiler vendors include it. Depending on the processor, packed structures might not be as efficient to access as the regular, un-packed structures

### [[3. Variables and Pointers|Pointers]] to struct
- **Mental Image**: Big chunk of memory in big table of bytes, just sitting there and other memory locations i.e. pointer, have the address of the first element of this big chunk.
- It is possible to have nested structs, and these can lead to the struct objects use lot of memory. So, assigning them to another instance could be mean lot of copying involved and this can be prevented by using pointers to them, so instances can refer to them , but the original instance remain in place in memory.

```C
/*
pointer type is created by simply adding a star after the type name. This is exactly how you make pointers to structure types as well. For example, pp is a pointer to the Point type
*/
Point *pp;

/*
Remember this: Best way to handle C declarations is to read it backwards, so pp, is a variable(location in the big table of bytes) that holds address(location) of 'Point' variables.
*/
```

```C
/*
To initialize a pointer you can take an address of a variable with the address-of operator. For example, you can set pp to point to the pa Point
*/
pp = &pa;
```

```C
/*
apply the star operator in front of a pointer to obtain the object pointed to by the pointer. So, if pp is a pointer to Point, *pp is the Point type. From there you can access any member using the dot operator.

Note that the parentheses around *pp are necessary, because the precedence of the '.' operator is very high, even higher than the '*' operator.
*/
(*pp).x = some_value;

/*
But pointers to structures are so frequently used in C that the language offers an alternative operator 'arrow' as a quicker way to access a structure member via a pointer.
*/
pp->x = some_value;
```

- Structure for the compiler is nothing else but a bunch of offsets, one for each member, from the beginning of the structure.
- This concept allow to access hardware registers as they are just offsets from a given base address.
-  The idea now is to design a C structure in such a way that its data members would correspond to all the registers within a given hardware block, such as SY2CTL or GPIO.


### CMSIS
- Motivation: 
	- Concept #1: For CPU, the hardware is an address to which a value has to be written, to access it, the address has to be de-referenced for example,  `*((unsigned long *)0x20000000) = 1U;` 
	- Concept #2: Hardware blocks are present together in the memory and various registers can be accessed as offset from the base address, basically the same way structs are handled by the compiler
- So combining these concepts, there are vendor-provided Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS) header files, which have the familiar typedef'd un-tagged declarations(these do not take memory, and there are no instances initialized as no point in allocating more memory to them as these hardware block already present in the memory map) of the hardware registers, logically grouped together like GPIO,I2C etc. Now at the end of the file, there are macros which are pointers to actual addresses and the programmer can use these to access the hardware. 
- How to make sure that the SYSCTL or GPIO structures are at the right [[4. Blinking LED#Typecasting Raw Addresses|base addresses]]. The solution is to use *pointers* to structures initialized to the hard-coded base address from the datasheet. At the end of the file, you can find #-defined base addresses of various hardware blocks. And below that you have a bunch #-defined hard-coded pointers to various structure types.

```C

/*
__IO,__I and __O are basically macros of volatile but convenient as it is used to indicate R/W,R or W only nature of the registers
*/
typedef struct {
__IO uint32_t DATA_Bits[255]; // Bit specific data registers
__IO uint32_t DATA; // Data register.
__IO uint32_t DIR; // Data direction register.
__IO uint32_t IS; // Interrupt sense register.
__IO uint32_t IBE; // Interrupt both edges register.
__IO uint32_t IEV; // Interrupt event register.
__IO uint32_t IM; // Interrupt mask register.
__I uint32_t RIS; // Raw interrupt status register.
__I uint32_t MIS; // Masked interrupt status reg.
__O uint32_t ICR; // Interrupt clear register.
__IO uint32_t AFSEL; // Mode control select register.
uint8_t RESERVED1[220];
__IO uint32_t DR2R; // 2ma drive select register.
__IO uint32_t DR4R; // 4ma drive select register.
__IO uint32_t DR8R; // 8ma drive select register.
__IO uint32_t ODR; // Open drain select register.
__IO uint32_t PUR; // Pull up select register.
__IO uint32_t PDR; // Pull down select register.
__IO uint32_t SLR; // Slew rate control enable reg.
__IO uint32_t DEN; // Digital input enable register.
__IO uint32_t LOCK; // Lock register.
__O uint32_t CR; // Commit register.
__IO uint32_t AMSEL; // Analog Mode Select
__IO uint32_t PCTL; // Port Control
__IO uint32_t ADCCTL; // ADC Control
__IO uint32_t DMACTL; // DMA Control
} GPIO_Type;

...
#define GPIO_PORTA_BASE 0x40004000 // GPIO Port A
/*
The point of GPIO_Type is to get the various offsets when you do GPIO->DATA, etc.
*/
#define GPIOA ((GPIO_Type *)GPIO_PORTA_BASE)

```

- So the hardware address is referenced by a pointer, then de-referenced by dot operator or by pointer->member to put the value and will give the offsets i.e. the register to put the value into as the pointer is type casted as a structure. **Mental image**: Hardware block is already part of the big table of bytes and another variable/macro is storing the address, so you can follow the chain from the variable--->to the hardware base block in the memory map--->to the particular register situated some offset away from the base given by it's position in the struct declaration using -> operator.
