## Lesson 20: Race Conditions
- The setup: The `while(1)` consists of a read-modify-store sequence of instruction, the `SysTick` interrupt is set to trigger after the read but before the store. The ISR modifies the value of the the register. So, after the interrupt returns, the code uses the previous value of the register as it was already read into the register and thus invalidating any changes done in the ISR.
- The interrupted code was unaware of changes in the ISR.
- This is called a RACE CONDITION. It occurs when two or more pieces of code that can preempt each other access a shared resource in such a way that the result depends on the sequence of execution of these pieces of code.

- Each individual piece of code works correctly. The problem only occurs when the pieces of code are executing together and preempt each other in various places, over which you have no control.  This results in bugs that tend to be intermittent, hard to reproduce, and hard to isolate, as typically there are only narrow time windows when preemption leads to bugs. This means that you might be testing your system for hours or weeks, never noticing any problems.
- They are the direct consequence and a huge price for using interrupts.

### Strategies to eliminate race condition bugs
- Mutual Exclusion i.e. we make sure that only one piece of concurrent code can execute while accessing a shared resource.
	- For simple and short code sequence, we can implement mutual exclusion by disabling and then enabling interrupts around that section. Any interrupt happening during execution of this section(known as critical section), will be served after the interrupt is enabled after.
	-  the intrinsic function `__disable_irq()` / `__enable_irq()` generates just one machine instruction `CPSID/E i`. There is no function call overhead here and executes in one clock cycle so the overhead of disabling/enabling interrupts is really small.
	-  The introduction of critical sections serialized the access to the shared resource and made it atomic, meaning indivisible.
	- With critical sections in place, the pieces of code, can run either before or after each other, but not in the middle. This is what mutually exclusive access means.

- Even better than mutual exclusion is to avoid race conditions by not sharing any resources in the first place.
	- If the shared resource happens to be GPIO, then using the bit-banded address means that there is no sharing of the common DATA register as their are different addresses of all the possible combination of the data bits.
	- And there is no need for the read-modify-write sequence either. Setting a given bit is accomplished by a simple atomic write to the dedicated register(which is not shared among the code that can preempt each other) and so is clearing of a given bit.
