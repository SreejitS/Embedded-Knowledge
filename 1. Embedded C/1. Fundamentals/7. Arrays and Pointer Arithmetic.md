## Lesson 7: Arrays and Pointer Arithmetic
- When you use Bitwise operators to modify certain bits in a byte, the compiler converts it into read, modify and write operations, as all the bits are collocated in a single byte with single address and **cannot be addressed individually** . If a interrupt happens after read and the ISR changes the state of register, and when the interrupt returns the change will be lost as it will use the old value of register. This is not reentrant code. 
- There is a way to address individual bits/all the combinations of them and modify them in a single operation, using bit-banding, where each bit and all the combinations have different address and can be modified using a single STR instructions, making them interrupt-safe.

> For example there is a 8-bit GPIO register, so each of the value i.e. 0 to 255 have their own addresses in sequences and using arrays makes sense to access them by knowing the base address and the offset

- There is a equivalence in array-indexing and pointer arithmetic.

> unsigned int array[3] and * (array + 3) are basically the same thing, C treats array as the pointer, storing the address of the first element in it. 

- The following is valid only for stellaris launchpad: We can optimize the code by using AHB(new and faster) bus as GPIO peripherals are connected to both APB(old and slow) and AHB for backward compatibility.
- This is done by setting a bit in GPIO High Performance Bus Control Register.
