## Lesson 6: Bitwise Operators

- Efficient way to set/clear bits as there are single instructions for these.
- Right shifting is equivalent of dividing by 2^(the number of bits shifted)
- Left shifting is equivalent of multiplying by 2^(the number of bits shifted)
- There is a difference is right shifting unsigned and signed integers. When right shifting unsigned integers, the processor will use logical shift operator(*will fill in zeros from the left*), but for unsigned it will use arithmetic shift operator to preserve the sign of the value(*will fill in ones from the left*). 
- Setting and clearing bits 

```C

#define BITMASK (1U << 3) // 0x4
PORT |= BITMASK // Set 3rd bit from the left
PORT &= ~BITMASK // Clear 3rd bit from the left

/* These are implemented as load-modify-store instructions and are done using dedicated instructions for the modifying part*/

```

- These C-statements are generally converted into read-modify-store sequences of machine instructions, making it non-re-entrant, so special technique, called [[7. Arrays and Pointer Arithmetic|bit-banding]] is used.
