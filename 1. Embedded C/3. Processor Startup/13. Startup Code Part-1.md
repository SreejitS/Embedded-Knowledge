## Lesson 13: Startup Code Part-1
- Things covered: startup code and how the CPU gets from reset to main
- startup code: the code that runs even before the main function. Standard startup code gets linked with your application from whatever toolset you use, IAR, GCC etc.
- In debug settings, un-check run to main, to explore the startup code.
- The following is valid for the startup code used by the IAR.
- We see that we are not starting with main. Instead the first label in the code we hit is `__iar_program_start()`. In the initial state, most of the registers are initialized to zero, except the [[13. Startup Code Part-1#Reset sequence of Cortex M4 Processor|stack pointer SP]], which seems to be initialized to a reasonable value inside the RAM.
- The first interesting instruction is BL (branch with link) which is a function call. Here, the function being called is  `__iar_init_vfp()`, which initializes the hardware floating point unit (FPU). FPU needs to be initialized early, in case any code downstream, such as main, wants to use it.
- The second function call is to `?main`. This is an illegal name for a C function, but we are here before the C language, so the C rules for naming functions don't apply. This is an IAR specific startup code and they have chosen to call it `?main`.
- Inside this, we have function call to `__low_level_init()`. This function is intended to perform a customized initialization of your hardware that either must occur very early on, or can speed up the startup process. For example, increase the CPU clock speed to execute the startup code faster. If there are no [[13. Startup Code Part-1#Data Section|data sections]] to be initialized, then it returns `0` and the `__call_main()` function is executed which BL to main function of the application.
- **Not sure but all these functions are called using BL,  leaf functions, maybe, not sure**

### Data Section
![[data_sections.png]]

- To know the various data sections, we .map file of the project. Using this file, we can know how big your program is in terms of code space in ROM and data space in ROM and RAM. General types of data, such as read-only code(sum of all compiled module objects), read-only data, and read-write data(the size of stack comes under this).
- For the linker, a program section is simply a contiguous chunk of memory that has a symbolic name.
- Some sections: `.text` for code, `.rodata` for read-only data. These sections are in the ROM address range.
- There are several `.bss` sections, which hold uninitialized data that need to be set to zero during the system startup. This is in the RAM address range.
- At last, at the very bottom, there is the `CSTACK` section, which holds the stack and is left uninitialized during the startup.
- For initialized data, linker adds a new section `Initializer bytes` in ROM space and adds `.data` section with the same length as that of the `Initializer bytes` in RAM space. Please note that the startup code does not initialize the data in the way specified in the code, the linker has specifically reordered the variables so that all initialized data can be initialized in a single block copy from `Initializer bytes` section to the `.data` sections.


### Initializing Data Sections
- Why? For a standard-compliant startup code, like the one provided in the IAR library, by the time main() is called, the C standard requires all initialized variables to have their initial values and all uninitialized variables to be set to zero.
- **Clearing `.bss` Data Section:** Data section is initialized using `__iar_data_init3()` call. This will zero-initialize the data. The STR instruction writes zeros to a 4-byte word at the beginning of the first `.bss` section in RAM in loop and each pass clears a word in the `.bss` section. After clearing `.bss`, the startup code proceeds to copying the data into the .data section. [[13. Startup Code Part-1#Note|Note]]
- **Copying data:** The actual copying is done by the LDR/STR instruction pair that points to the source of the data, which is the beginning of the `Initializer bytes` section in ROM. The target of the data is the beginning of the `.data` section in RAM. The code loops and initializes the whole `.data` section.
- Now the data section in initialized. The startup completes and the main function is called.


### Reset sequence of Cortex M4 Processor
- *How does processor execute `__iar_program_start()` at the beginning and how the SP is filled with a value?* The ARM Cortex-M processor is hardwired such that after reset it copies the bits from address 0 to the SP register, and the all bits except the least-significant-bit from address 0x4 to the PC.
- These things are part of *vector table* along with the addresses of the exception handlers.
- General rule: In cortex m4, if any memory location i.e. variable or ROM address contain address, it is saved with the LSB set to 1, so that when copied to PC it does not cause bus fault as this supports only Thumb2 instruction set, and cannot enforce ARM instruction set by clearing the LSB of PC.

### Exception Handler
- Apparently, the IAR startup code defines all exception handlers, such as Bus-Fault, Debug-Monitor, Hard-Fault, Memory-Manager, and Non-Maskable-Interrupt, but they all point to the same piece of code. Knowing only this common address, the disassembler could not distinguish among the various exception handlers, and chose to show only the `BusFault_Handler` in the debug window, because this one is the first in the alphabetical order.
- When developing, it is okay to have the code associated with all these exception handlers to be endless loop which ties up the CPU. But for production, this is not acceptable as it will cause the device to appear completely locked and unresponsive. This is known as denial of service.
- [[14. Startup Code Part-2|In the next part]], we will replace the generic vector table(*data structure at address 0 in ROM*) with a real one that can handle all interrupts and write the exception handlers that can be used in a production-quality code

#### Note
- Startup code from other vendors might not comply with the C standard and may not clear the uninitialized variables in the `.bss` section. Then we might have to explicitly initialize all uninitialized variables to zero. This is not optimal, because then we essentially convert the `.bss` sections to `.data` sections, which require a matching "Initializer bytes" section in ROM. In other words, we take space in ROM for a bunch of zeros.
