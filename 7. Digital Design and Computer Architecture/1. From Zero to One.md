## 1.a Managing complexity
There are systematic approach to deal with complexity. Modern digital systems are built from millions or even billions of transistors. No one can understand the whole system by keeping all of details of electron movement through each of them in mind at once. We need a way to manage the complexity without getting lost if gory details. We do that by using the following ideas.
### Abstraction
This is central idea when dealing with complexity. Hide the details when not important.

#### Key Points
- At the lowest level of abstraction is the physics, the motion of electrons. The behavior of electrons is described by quantum mechanics and Maxwell’s equations.
- Our system is constructed from electronic devices such as transistors. These devices have well-defined connection points called terminals and can be modeled by the relationship between voltage and current as measured at each terminal. ***By abstracting to this device level, we can ignore the individual electrons.***
- The next level of abstraction is analog circuits, in which devices are assembled to create components such as amplifiers. ***Analog circuits input and output a continuous range of voltages.***
- Digital circuits such as logic gates restrict the voltages to **discrete ranges**, which we will use to indicate 0 and 1. In logic design, we build more complex structures, such as adders or memories, from digital circuits.
- Microarchitecture links the logic and architecture levels of abstraction. It involves combining logic elements to execute the instructions defined by the architecture.
- The architecture level of abstraction describes a computer from the programmer’s perspective.
- The operating system handles low-level details.
- Finally, the application software uses these facilities provided by the operating system to solve a problem for the user.
 **`Thanks to the power of abstraction, anyones grandmother can surf the Web without any regard for the quantum vibrations of electrons or the organization of the memory in her computer.`**
### Discipline
Discipline is the act of intentionally restricting your design choices so that you can work more productively at a higher level of abstraction. Digital discipline is where we are limiting ourselves to discrete voltages, making them easy to design and combine together and ultimately out performing it's analog counterparts.  
### The three Y's
#### Hierarchy
It involves dividing a system into modules, then further subdividing each of these modules until the pieces are easy to understand.
#### Modularity
It states that the modules have well-defined functions and interfaces, so that they connect together easily without unanticipated side effects.
#### Regularity
It seeks uniformity among the modules. Common modules are reused many times, reducing the number of distinct modules that must be designed.
## 1.b Number Systems
- Digital systems represent information with discrete-valued variables—that is, variables with a finite number of distinct values.
- The beauty of this digital *abstraction* is that digital designers can focus on 1’s and 0’s, ignoring whether the Boolean variables are physically represented with specific voltages, rotating gears or whatever
- A computer programmer can work without needing to know the intimate details of the computer hardware.
- An individual bit doesn’t carry much information. We groups them together to represent numbers, letters and programs.

- There are two ways to represent negative numbers in binary
	- **Sign/Magnitude** : An N-bit sing/magnitude uses the most significant bit to indicate the sign and the remaining N-1 bits to represent the magnitude(the absolute value). 
		- Problems : Two representations for zero(+0 and -0) and binary addition does not work.
	- Two's complement : They are identical to unsigned binary numbers except that the most significant bit position has a weight of −2^(N−1) instead of 2^(N−1). They overcome the shortcomings of sign/magnitude numbers: zero has a single representation, and ordinary addition works.
		- In two’s complement representation, zero is written as all zeros
		- The most positive number has a 0 in the most significant position and 1’s elsewhere: 01…111 = 2^(N−1) − 1
		- −1 is written as all ones: 11…111
		- The sign of a two’s complement number is reversed in a process called taking the two’s complement. The process consists of inverting all of the bits in the number, then adding 1 to the least significant bit position. This is useful to find the representation of a negative number or to determine the magnitude of a negative number.

## 1.c CMOS Transistors
![[Pasted image 20231202151617.png]]
- nMOS transistors are good at passing 0’s, so a pull-down network of nMOS transistors is placed between the output and GND to pull the output down to 0
- pMOS transistors are good at passing 1’s, so a pull-up network of pMOS transistors is placed between the output and VDD to pull the output up to 1
- The networks may consist of transistors in series or in parallel.
	- When transistors are in parallel, the network is ON if either transistor is ON.
	- When transistors are in series, the network is ON only if both transistors are ON
- In a properly functioning logic gate, one of the networks should be ON and the other OFF at any given time, so that the output is pulled HIGH or LOW but not shorted or floating. We can guarantee this by using the rule of conduction complements. When nMOS transistors are in series, the pMOS transistors must be in parallel. When nMOS transistors are in parallel, the pMOS transistors must be in series.
