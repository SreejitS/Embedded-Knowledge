##### Implementing the VTABLE and VPTR for the base class
- To implement the late binding in C, we need to add the VPTR structure to the base class as the first attribute
```C
/* Shape's attributes... */
typedef struct {
    struct ShapeVtable const *vptr; /* virtual pointer */

    int16_t x; /* x-coordinate of Shape's position */
    int16_t y; /* y-coordinate of Shape's position */
} Shape;
```
- The VPTR will be the first attribute, and will be a pointer to the `const ShapeVtable`  structure. This `const` will allow the VTABLE to reside in ROM.
- `ShapeVtable`  is a structure of pointers to all *virtual* functions, such as draw() and area() in the case of the Shape class.
```C
struct ShapeVtable {
	
	/* pointer to draw() method */
    void (*draw)(Shape const * const me);
    
    /* pointer to area() method */
    uint32_t (*area)(Shape const * const me);
};
```
- C language allows you to provide a pointer to a function, just like you can provide a pointer to a variable. In both cases, a pointer contains the address (of the function or variable, respectively) and also the type information about the entity that is being pointed to.
- In case of pointers to functions, the type information consist of the full signature of the function.
- To declare a pointer to the draw() function, you first need to write the signature of this function.
```C
/* Full C function signature */
void Shape_draw(Shape const * const me);
uint32_t Shape_area(Shape const * const me);

```
- Then, you need to convert the actual name of the function into a pointer, which means using the asterisk operator.
```C
void *draw(Shape const * const me);
uint32_t *area(Shape const * const me);
```
- But because of the specific operator precedence rules in C, the asterisk would be bound to the return value instead of the function name, so you need to add explicit parentheses around the pointer, like this.
```C
void (*draw)(Shape const * const me);
uint32_t (*area)(Shape const * const me);
```

##### Invoking these virtual functions
- We can inline few function calls to remover the function call overhead and define it in the header file itself. *Note: `static inline` is introduced in C99. Using MACRO definitions is the way if the complier is C89*
```C
/* virtual calls (late binding) */
static inline void Shape_draw_vcall(Shape const * const me) {
    /* Explicit use of de-reference of the me pointer */
    (*me->vptr->draw)(me); 
   // This too works
   // me->vptr->draw(me);
} 

static inline uint32_t Shape_area_vcall(Shape const * const me) {
    return (*me->vptr->area)(me);
}
```

##### Setting up the VTABLE in ROM
- Inside the base class's constructor functions, we define an instance of the `struct ShapeVtable` in the ROM, meaning that it will be both `static`, that is not on the stack, and `const`.
- Now, a `const` object cannot be changed, so you must immediately initialize at the point of creation.
```C
void Shape_ctor(Shape * const me, int16_t x0, int16_t y0) {
    static const struct ShapeVtable vtable = {
        &Shape_draw,
        &Shape_area
    };
    
    me->vptr = &vtable;
    me->x = x0;
    me->y = y0;
}
```
- At the level of the Shape class, you cannot really provide meaningful implementations, because Shape is too abstract. So, for now you just leave the functions empty, but to avoid compiler warnings about unused parameters, you can use the idiom of casting the unused parameter on void.
```C
/* The real implementation will be replacing them using the virtual calls */
static void Shape_draw(Shape const * const me) {
    (void)me; /* unused parameter */
}

static uint32_t Shape_area(Shape const * const me) {
    (void)me; /* unused parameter */
    return 0U;
}
```
- The `drawGraph` function is modified by changing the function call to the virtual call that we implemented
```C
/* draw all shapes in a given array graph[] */
void drawGraph(Shape const *graph[]) {
    uint8_t i;
    for (i = 0; graph[i] != (Shape *)0; ++i) {
        //graph[i]->draw();  /* polymorphism! in C++ */
        Shape_draw_vcall(graph[i]); /* polymorphism! */
    }
}
```

##### Implementing the VTABLE and VPTR for the derived class
- They will all inherit the VPTR and the virtual call mechanism from base class i.e. Shape. But, each subclass, like Rectangle, still needs to provide its own VTABLE and its own specific implementation of the virtual functions like draw() and area(). This was the main purpose of polymorphism.
- When assigning the function pointers in the derived class, we find that the we have to cast them as the function pointers of the base class, as `ShapeVtable` is defined in the base class.
- So, to make the Rectangle signatures fit into the VTABLE originally defined for the Shape base class, you need to cast pointer-to-functions, by using the whole function signatures, like this.
```C
static const struct ShapeVtable vtable = {
        (void (*)(Shape const * const me))&Rectangle_draw,
        (uint32_t (*)(Shape const * const me))&Rectangle_area
    };
```
- you can finally assign the inherited VPTR for the Rectangle class, but you need to be very careful to do it *after* calling the constructor of the Shape superclass. This is because, just like in C++, the Shape constructor sets the VPTR to point to the Shape’s VTABLE, but here you want to override this setting to the Rectangle’s VTABLE.
```C
Shape_ctor(&me->super, x0, y0); /* base class ctor */
me->super.vptr = &vtable;
```
- By following these steps, the C implementation of virtual functions works exactly like the C++ original, down to the machine instructions for late binding.

#### When to use polymorphism
- If we need object-specific behavior during runtime, we should go for it. So instead of invoking specific functions for different objects, we can use polymorphism to select the right implementation at run-time
- Codes making decisions at runtime based on the product type, version numbers and similar variables, end up running the code for a single specific product. SO the selection happens at compile-and-link time. 
- Even if polymorphism can eliminate all the IF-ELSE logic, this kind of codebase is not a good contender for it. 
- A better way is to design a clean BSP interface and then provide different implementations for different products. 
- This comes under the *physical design* as opposed to *logical design*, which is the way you partition your code into directories and files, such as header files and implementation files. That way, you can build the final software for any given product by combining various modules at *link-time*, rather than using techniques like polymorphism at runtime.
