#### Inheritance
- This is the ability to define new classes based on existing classes in order to reuse classes.
- It is a mechanism for reusing common attributes and operations
- If we embed a structure inside another structure in the beginning, like the following:
```C
#ifndef RECTANGLE_H
#define RECTANGLE_H

#include "shape.h"

/* Rectangle's attributes... */
typedef struct {
    Shape super; /* inherited Shape */
  
    /* attributes specific to this class */
    uint16_t width;
    uint16_t height;
} Rectangle;

/* Rectangle's operations... */
void Rectangle_ctor(Rectangle * const me,
                    int16_t x0, int16_t y0,
                    uint16_t w0, uint16_t h0);
void Rectangle_draw(Rectangle const * const me);
uint32_t Rectangle_area(Rectangle const * const me);

#endif /* RECTANGLE_H */
```
- then in C, a pointer to this bigger structure can be safely casted to a pointer to the initial member of the structure. As in pointer to  Rectangle object can be safely cast to a pointer to Shape.
- This has rather important implications for the Rectangle class, because it means that any pointer to Rectangle can be safely passed to a function expecting a pointer to Shape. This means that all operations for Shapes apply to Rectangles as well.
- In this sense, the Rectangle class *inherits* all operations from the Shape class.
- Such pointer casting is called upcasting.

##### Mental model for thinking about Inheritance
- Inheritance establishes the "Is A..." relationship, such that it makes sense to say "a Rectangle IS A Shape".
- This is similar to the biological classification and as we go down we increase the specification. Moving up is towards more generalization. And hence it is called the casting as this is the direction of the generalization. 
- Also, the behaviors introduced in the higher level classes make sense to be inherited by the lower-level classes.

##### Class composition vs Class Inheritance
- We implemented inheritance by literally embedding an instance of the superclass inside the subclass. This means that the subclass is a *composition* of the superclass plus some added attributes and operations. This points to some similarities between inheritance and composition.
- And in fact both approaches can accomplish similar goals, but there is an important difference. Inheritance is the “is a...” relationship, which comes about only when you embed the superclass as the very *first* attribute, so that every instance of the subclass  can be treated as an instance of the superclass.
- If you move the superclass instance to a different position, you  still have composition, which is the “has a...” relationship, like Rectangle has a Shape. But you can no longer legitimately perform upcasting. Instead, you would have to explicitly reference the component  attribute inside the Rectangle class, which would break encapsulation.

##### Inheritance in C++
- We can publicly or privately inherit other classes.
- We need to invoke the base classes constructor while writing the constructor for the derived class
- In order to make the attributes of the base class accessible by the derived class, we need to change the label from private to protected. This means that derived classes at any level can access such attributes directly, but the attributes are still protected against any public access.
- We can use the this pointer to see that it points to the initial member and is upcasted when executing the base class's functions.

-  Inheritance enables even more reuse as well as extensibility through the third fundamental object-oriented concept of *[[3. OOP Part 3 Polymorphism in C++|polymorphism]]*.
