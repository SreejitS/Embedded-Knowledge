#### Polymorphism
- It is the ability to substitute objects of the matching interfaces for one another at run-time.
- Unlike the notions of encapsulation and inheritance, polymorphism is a uniquely object-oriented concept that has no direct analog in a traditional procedural language like C.
- We know, using inheritance property, the derived class adds it's own attributes and functions apart from the one inherited by the base class.
- Now, thinking using the biological classification, we can say that the derived class "is a" sub class and hence the functions of the derived class could move into more generalized direction or "upcasted".
- Since the base class is a generic version of the derived class, we would not know how the actual implementation will look like for each derived class at this high level.

##### Example
- we add the derived class i.e. Rectangle's operations to the base class i.e. Shape's declaration as follows
```C
class Shape {
protected:    /* Shape's attributes... */
    int16_t x; /* x-coordinate of Shape's position */
    int16_t y; /* y-coordinate of Shape's position */
public:    /* Shape's operations... */
    Shape(int16_t x0, int16_t y0);
    void moveBy(int16_t dx, int16_t dy);
    uint16_t distanceFrom(Shape const * other) const;
  
    /* Rectangle's operations */
    void draw() const;
    uint32_t area() const;
};
```
- And in the main code, if we up-cast the pointer
```C
Shape *ps = &r1; /* upcasting! */
```
- And call the operation from the pointer
```C
ps->draw();
```
- It would invoke the functions implemented in the Shape class i.e. the base class.
- This means the compiler evidently chose the function corresponding to the type of the pointer, not the type of the object.
- Now if we add virtual keyword in front of the functions of the Shape class i.e.
```C
    /* Rectangle's operations */
    virtual void draw() const;
    virtual uint32_t area() const;
```
- and repeat the exercise, we find that this time the compiler executes the Rectangle class's implementation of these functions.
- This means now, the compiler select implementations based on the type of the object, which is Rectangle, not the type of the pointer, which remains Shape. This is *polymorphism* in action.
- The term “polymorphism” itself comes from the Greek roots “poly” meaning many and “morphe” meaning form. So polymorphism means multiple forms.
- The same operation, such as draw() or area(), can take multiple forms, depending on the type of the object that the pointer happens to be pointing to.

##### Practical Usefulness of the Polymorphism
- It allows you to write generic code at a higher level of abstraction(i.e. at the base class level) than you could without it.
- For example, suppose that you want to draw a graph consisting of multiple Shapes on your LCD screen. For simplicity, suppose that a graph is an array of pointers to various Shape objects.

- Note that the Shape pointers in a graph might actually point to different types, but because all of them inherit the Shape base class, all can be safely up-cast to the Shape type.
![[drawShape_2.JPG]]
- Now, you can declare a generic function `drawGraph()` at the Shape class level.
```C
/* Inside the shape.h header file */
void drawGraph(Shape const *graph[]);
```
- And implement it in shape-dot-cpp. 
```C
/* Inside the shape.cpp */
/* draw all shapes in a given array graph[] */
void drawGraph(Shape const *graph[]) {
    uint8_t i;
    for (i = 0; graph[i] != (Shape *)0; ++i) {
        graph[i]->draw(); /* polymorphism! */
    }
}
```
- The `darwGraph()` function simply loops over the Shape pointers in the graph array until it encounters a zero pointer.
- The pivotal point of the implementation is the `graph[i]->draw()` call that employs polymorphism to correctly select the draw() implementation depending on the type of the object, not the type of the pointer, which is evidently Shape.
- The interesting part is that any new class can be derived and the base class's high level implementation need not be changed to incorporate the object of the new derived class.  For example, we can add a new derived class called Circle and call the `drawGraph()` function on it. The shape class is not recompiled. This shows the design is extensible.

##### Methods
- Due to polymorphism, the functions in the derived class are not completely new functions, they are just different forms of the functions already specified in the base class.
- Therefore, *methods* describe the different forms of the same operation and the different methods in the subclasses are said to *override* the original method inherited from the base class.
- So, in the derived class's declaration the methods also have virtual keyword explicitly in front of them to suggest they are merely polymorphic form the the methods already declared in the base class.

##### Virtual Call Mechanism vs Normal Call Mechanism
- *Normal call*:  Function call on a full object, rather that up-casted pointer is always a regular, non-virtual function call, even though the operation itself might be declared virtual. This is because the exact type of the object is know at compile time. Incidentally, the connection between the function call and function body is called “call binding”.
- The connection established at compile and link time is called “early binding”. This is the only call binding used in the procedural languages like C.
- But in C++, a virtual function invoked on a pointer, establishes a different call binding, because the exact type of the object is not known at compile time since the pointer might be  actually up-cast from a derived class. This type of binding is called  “late binding”, “dynamic binding”, or “real-time binding”.

##### Implementation of Virtual Call Mechanism
- The compiler adds a pointer at the beginning of the class  attributes, which points to a table in ROM that contains addresses of all virtual functions.  
- In the literature, the table of virtual functions is called the VTABLE and the pointer to it stored in the object is called the VPTR.
![[virtual-call.JPG]]
- So, in summary, compared to early binding, the overhead of late binding is the additional VPTR in every object in RAM, one VTABLE per class in ROM and two more instructions per function call.
![[early-vs-late-call-binding.JPG]]
- This is not a large overhead for what you are getting, but still it is non-negligible and therefore C++ applies this mechanism only to functions specified explicitly as “virtual”. This is to prevent the overhead for functions that don’t need late binding.
- *Who sets the VPTR?* 
	- VPTR is initialized and re-initialized in every constructor to point to the VTABLE of that class. But the order of constructor calls is such that the super classes i.e. base classes are always initialized before subclasses i.e. derived classes, so the VPTR ends up pointing to the last derived class, which is correct as it is this implementation that the VPTR should finally be pointing to, thus taking on it's polymorphic form.
