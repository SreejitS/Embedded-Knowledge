#### Introduction
- We will focus on the Real-Time Kernel component of the RTOS, which is responsible for multitasking
- RTOS is an example of sequential architecture
- Focus: To extend the basic sequential architecture to execute other piece of sequential code independently and simultaneously. Think of this two pieces as two tasks or two events that the processor has to process and respond, and we are thinking of ways to implement this with the most flexibility.
- In-order to do this, while preserving the simple sequential structure of the code, we would need not one but TWO background loops running somehow simultaneously.

##### Proof-of-concept
- Let's assume the control is in background loop and then the foreground loop pre-empts it and the serves an interrupt. 
- Now, the general flow is to complete the foreground loop and return exactly back to the same background loop, at the point of pre-emption(which would be saved in the interrupt stack frame). 
- If we happen to change the address of return to some other valid background loop's address, just before the interrupt returns, then this makes the control return to the other background loop. 
- This is a proof-of-concept that we can switch back and forth between different background loops using interrupt, while still preserving the sequential nature of the individual background loops.
- Conclusion
	- First of all, you can see that such switching the CPU between executing multiple background loops should be possible.
	- Second, the exercise points you to the general mechanism for such CPU context switching, which is to exploit the interrupt processing hardware already available in your processor.
	- And third, the exercise illustrates the general idea of multitasking on a single CPU, which is to switch the CPU between executing different background loops.

##### RTOS definition
- In the proof-of-concept, we were doing the switching manually, but the process can be automated in special software called the Real-Time Operating System Kernel or RTOS-Kernel for short. Software that extends the basic foreground/background architecture by allowing you to run multiple background loops (called Threads or Tasks) on a single CPU.
- Another important term is Multithreading or Multitasking, which is, switching the CPU context frequently from one Thread to another to create an illusion that each such Thread has the whole CPU all to itself.
- *The term "Thread", is essentially the background loops from the foreground/background architecture.*

##### Extending the Proof-of-Concept in the right way
- Normal flow: in the case of the regular interrupt preemption, you save registers for the blinky1 thread and restore the registers for the same blinky1 thread. As long as you actually return to the blinky1 thread, everything is OK.

- Proof-of-concept flow: However, when you manually modify the return address, you are returning to the blinky2 thread, but you still restore the registers saved originally for the blinky1 thread, which is exactly the illegal part. It happens to just work for the dead-simple blinky threads, but it can and will break down for more complex threads that use more registers.
	- ![[proof-of-concept-flow.JPG]]
- The fix: To fix it, you need to keep the register sets for different threads separate. In other words, the registers saved for blinky1 cannot be restored for blinky2 and vice-versa. This means is that you need to use a separate, private stack for each thread.

##### Code for extending the basic Proof-of-concept
- Using a separate, private stack for each thread, boils down to to just using an area in RAM and a pointer that points to the current top of that stack(and this is used to fill in the SP register of the processor and then execute the return-from-interrupt sequence).
```C
/* such a memory area can be represented as an array of uint32_t words (corresponding to the 32-bit registers of the CPU)*/
/* The ARM CPU requires that the ISR stack frame be aligned at the 8-byte boundary. This is the case here, because the stack array was sized at 40 32-bit words, which aligns the end at 8-byte boundary. This means that the "aligner" stack entry is not necessary.*/
uint32_t stack_blinky1[40];

/* For Full-descending stack, the stack pointer is initialised to location one beyond the end of stack array*/
uint32_t *sp_blinky1 = &stack_blinky1[40];

/* We need to pre-fill each thread's stack with a fabricated Cortex-M interrupt stack frame. The goal is to make the stack look as if it was preempted by an interrupt just before calling the thread function.*/
/* fabricated Cortex-M ISR stack frame for blinky1 */
/*  The ARM CPU uses a "full stack", which means that the stack pointer points to the last used stack entry as opposed to the first free entry. Therefore to add a new stack entry, you first decrement the stack pointer to get to the first free location, and then you de-reference it to write a value to this location.*/
*(--sp_blinky1) = (1U << 24); /* xPSR */
*(--sp_blinky1) = (uint32_t)&main_blinky1; /* PC */
*(--sp_blinky1) = 0x0000000EU; /* LR */
*(--sp_blinky1) = 0x0000000CU; /* R12 */
*(--sp_blinky1) = 0x00000003U; /* R3 */
*(--sp_blinky1) = 0x00000002U; /* R2 */
*(--sp_blinky1) = 0x00000001U; /* R1 */
*(--sp_blinky1) = 0x00000000U; /* R0 */
```
- Now when you break at the end of ISR, we manually change the SP to current top of the stack, i.e. value of `sp_blinky1`. On resuming you will find that the exception mechanism of the processor will restore the context from the RAM and will execute `blink1()`. 
- Now again break at ISR, and copy the sp_blinky2 into SP. 
- We break at the end of the ISR so that CPU stores the current thread stack onto the private stack and when we return to this thread next time, it will resume from this point exactly as the threads will think it just returned from the ISR.
- So we need to copy the updated `sp_blinky1` from SP register to the `sp_blinky1` variable, as this will change in course of executing the `blink1` thread. 
- Now resume and the `blinky2()` thread will execute. 
- Now when we execute the `blinky1` thread again it will resume at precisely the point of preemption by the interrupt and not at the beginning of its thread function.

##### Understanding AAPCS to implement this correctly
- For ARM processors, the interrupt mechanism saves the the caller-saved registers i.e. `R0-R3,R12,PSR` automatically. So when we are doing this exercise, the thread can use `R4-R11` and from AAPCS we know the functions are obligated to save them and will restore them before returning. 
- But since we are using these functions in context of RTOS, the functions i.e. threads do no return to the point of pre-emption but to another thread. And that thread can also use `R4-R11` and then when we return to the first thread, the registers are clobbered. This means that is would not return to it's exact state if we rely only on the interrupt mechanism to restore the stack frame.
- In a multi-tasking environment we are not executing the whole thread function but rather just a piece of it. This piece of code doesn't need to comply with the AAPCS and it can change the values of `R4-R11`
- So, we need to have a mechanism where we are saving the callee-saved registers before the context switch and restore them to the processor register before when the interrupt mechanism restores the stack frame.
