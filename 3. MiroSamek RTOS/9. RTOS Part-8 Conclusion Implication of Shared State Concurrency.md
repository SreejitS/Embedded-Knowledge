- The "Shared-State Concurrency" programming model based on a traditional pre-emptive RTOS has been the dominating approach since  the 1980's, but it has several negative implications.
- The first-order ripple effects of resource sharing are race conditions and collisions in the time domain or data space. If left unprotected, these consequences lead directly to a system failure. 
- To avoid such failures, traditional RTOS provide an assortment of mutual exclusion mechanisms to protect the shared resources, but each of them lead to their own negative implications.
- Most of these second-order implications have negative impact on the real-time performance of the system and can lead to missed deadlines, which again means failure in hard real-time systems.
- But the "shared-state concurrency" model is no longer the only option on the market. The 1990's brought alternative real-time software architectures that avoid sharing of resources, and thus eliminate the need for complex mutual-exclusion mechanisms.
