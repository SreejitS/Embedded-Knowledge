#### Efficient blocking of threads
- We will replace the horribly inefficient polling for events with efficient BLOCKING of threads. Specifically, we will add a blocking delay function to the RTOS and learn about some far-reaching implications of thread blocking on the RTOS design.

##### Blocking Delay for Threads
- Threads using primitive polling delay is a waste of CPU cycle. We can eliminate this waste by context switch
- Instead of starting a brain dead polling loop, at the beginning of the delay, we can switch the context away from the delayed thread and then switch it back at the end of the delay period.
- In between these two context switches, the thread will be efficiently in a BLOCKED state, where the CPU is available for other threads.
- From the perspective of the thread, the blocking delay will be no different whatsoever from the polling delay. Either way, the thread will simply call a `delay()` function, which will not return until the delay elapses.
 
##### State diagram of a thread without blocking state
- When a thread is first created, meaning that you allocated the `OSThread` object and the stack for it, it becomes Dormant, shown here as a rounded-corner rectangle. In this state, it cannot do anything until you have called the `QSThread_start()` function on it.
	- After that call, a thread looks exactly as though it was preempted by an interrupt(as it fabricates the stack frame and the `R4-R11` registers), so it transitions to the stage of its life cycle shown as Preempted.
	- Finally, when the thread is scheduled for running, it transitions to the Running state. After a while, the thread gets scheduled out and another thread gets scheduled in, at which point the original thread becomes Preempted again.
	- *Note: In the single CPU system exactly one thread can be in he Running state at a time, which is shown here as a circle with number 1 in it.*

##### State diagram of a thread with blocking state
- Any running thread can call the `OS_delay()` function, at which time it becomes Blocked, meaning NOT Ready to run.
-  The transition out of the Blocked state must happen at the end of the delay.

##### Need of an Idle Thread
- This means if a thread is NOT Ready in the Blocked state, it must be Ready in the Preempted and Running states.
- In order to encompass all the possible states i.e. Ready-and-not-blocked *(includes threads which are running or in pre-empted state)*, Not-ready-to-run *(includes threads which are blocked)*, there must be a state which includes threads which is ready-and-not-blocked *(always in ready state and cannot be blocked)* or else the control goes out of the scheduler code and back to `main()` and exits.
- Introduction of the the blocked state to the thread has the implication of the need for an idle thread, which is the thread that should execute when all the threads are in blocked state in a given point in time.

##### `OsTick()`
- As The transition out of the Blocked state must happen at the end of the delay, this needs to be managed centrally for all threads by the RTOS, because a Blocked thread cannot do anything, and in particular, it cannot un-block itself.
- This central RTOS service will need to be activated periodically, typically from the system clock tick interrupt, and therefore will be called `OS_tick()`. Upon every activation, `OS_tick()` needs to update all delays of the individual threads which will be stored in the thread control block, and needs to un-block the threads, whose delays have elapsed.
- On calling the `OS_delay()` function with the required delay as argument, the value is stored in the thread control block's private delay member. 
- Then in the `SysTick` handler, each of the thread's stored delay is decremented till zero and on becoming 0 the RTOS unblocks the thread. Nothing is done in the `Systick` handler if the delay is already 0.

- *Coding Notes: `OS_delay()` implementation is to forbid calling it from the idle thread, because it should never go to the Blocked state. You can accomplish this by adding an assertion that the current thread is NOT the idle thread at index 0. This specific assertion type is called pre-condition, because it introduces a specific requirement that must be met before calling this service. To make this intent clear, the `quassert.h` header file provides a specific macro named `Q_REQUIRE()`, which works exactly like `Q_ASSERT()`, except its name conveys the intent much more precisely. This is a pre-condition, meaning the caller of the function is required to adhere to this constraint, not the function itself.*

##### Idle thread
- The idle thread is still wasting CPU cycles, so this is the best place to put `__WFI()` instruction that stops the CPU clock and put it in a low power mode, until an interrupt occurs . This is ideal for power saving in battery operated systems.

- The topic covered till now implements a round-robin timesharing scheduler with blocking, which corresponds to the state of the art of computer systems in the early 1960's. [[6. RTOS Part-5 What is real-time. Preemptive, priority-based scheduling|Next]] we will bring the RTOS into the 1970's by implementing the preemptive priority-based scheduling.
