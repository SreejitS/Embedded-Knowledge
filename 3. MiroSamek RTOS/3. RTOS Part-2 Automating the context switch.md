#### Automating the context switch
- RTOS's main job is exactly to extend the foreground/background architecture by allowing you to run multiple background loops on a single CPU and to create an illusion of concurrent execution by frequently switching the CPU among all these loops.
- The background loops managed by the RTOS are called "threads" or "tasks" and the switching from one such thread to another is called "context-switch".

##### Coding up function to create threads
- From the previous chapter, the following parameters are needed for creating different background loops
	- variable for keeping track of top of stack
	- address of background loop
	- place in RAM for private stack(start address and size)
- Traditionally the data structure that captures this information in called *Thread Control Block*.
- Now the context switch happens at the end of an interrupt return mechanism, such as `SysTick`. For that, in ARM cortex processors, we have a dedicated interrupt, `PendSV` that makes it easier to implement context switching. *Note: `PendSV` is not that special and in principle you could use any other asynchronous exception or interrupt for the purpose of context-switching.*
- The efficient way is to trigger the `PendSV`  when we decide to context-switch and implement the context switch algorithm in the `PendSV` handler. `PendSV` handler is set to the lowest for it not to pre-empt other handlers.
