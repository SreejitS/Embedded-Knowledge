#### Introduction
- The nested switch case is the most straight forward and hence the most common implementation of the state machines
- There is another way of thinking about this problem and that is the state table. This implementation is a stepping stone to understand and implement the state machine in a more elegant and efficient way in the future

#### State Tables
- The states can be listed in the vertical dimension and list events along the second, horizontal dimension. Now, every cell in the two-dimensional table contains the pair: next-state and action to be performed for the given event in a given state.

#### Actions
- There is another big improvement in state machines, which can eliminate many annoying repetitions in both your designs and code.
- If a state can be entered from different transitions and there are common steps of them, then we can group them together as entry actions.
- You don't need to apply the entry and exit mechanism just to the repeated actions on transitions. In fact, you should take a critical look at your entire state machine and check which actions would better fit into states rather than transitions.
- Generally, whatever is done in the entry actions, often needs to be undone in the exit actions, instead of doing it in the transition
```
State machines that associate actions with states are called Moore machines and state machines that associated actions with transitions are called Mealy machines.
```
-  Generally, software state machines shows that Moore-type state machines with actions associated with states tend to be generally better, cleaner, more robust and more maintainable than Mealy machines with actions associated with transitions.\

#### State table Implementation

- The main advantage of the state table representation is the highly regular structure that forces you to consider all possible state and event combinations. Also, the implementation provides relatively good and deterministic runtime performance.
- However, the technique has also many disadvantages. The whole state machine code is highly fragmented into a large number of little "action handlers". Also, state tables themselves tend to be sparse with a lot of gaps, because the event-signals are used as indexes into the table and it is difficult to avoid gaps in the numerical values of the signals. 
- The biggest disadvantage of state tables is that they discourage adding new states and events, because that requires adding the whole new column or row into the table. Developers perceive this as a lot of overhead, and therefore they tend to avoid it. Instead, they add internal variables and guard conditions, which leads back to "spaghetti code" and defeats the purpose of using state machines that were exactly intended to avoid the "spaghetti".
