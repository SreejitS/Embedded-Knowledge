#### Introduction
- We have seen the nested switch and the state table approach to implement the state machine. To arrive at an optimal solution, we can combine the advantages of each and try to figure to remove the disadvantages of them.
- Let's call these as the state handler approach
- To arrive at an optimal solution, it often pays off to start with first imagining what that ideal should look like, and then to work *backwards* to the implementation in a programming language, like C in this case.
- We can start by the most obvious element, that is the state and try to specify it in the most succinct way possible
	- It starts by naming the state
	- Then listing the transitions
		- Entry: The corresponding action
		- Exit: The corresponding action
		- Transitions: Actions followed by the state into which it transitions
		- Guard conditions: These can be if-else conditions along side the transitions specified above
	- The above structure is enough to specify a state machine and there are DSLs(Domain-Specific-Languages) like SMC to do this.
- The state specifications could be turned into C functions. This should make sense, because the main job of a state is to respond to events by executing action code, and executing code is exactly what function are for
