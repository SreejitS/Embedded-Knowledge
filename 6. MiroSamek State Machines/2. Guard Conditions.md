#### Guard Conditions
- The previous implementation is not flexible enough for many real-life situations. The reason is that the whole structure of states and transitions in a state machine is fixed at design time.
- But what if the behavior,--that is, the reactions to future events--depends on the user input, which is obviously not known until runtime?
- This means that for certain transitions you cannot know at design time which state to transition to. To address this need, the UML state machine notation includes the so called "choice pseudo states" and "guard conditions".
- The whole idea is actually very simple and is a way of combining a decision point from a flowchart with the transition notation. Specifically, a transition can go into a "choice pseudo state", depicted as a diamond.

- Out of this diamond shape, you can have several outgoing transition segments, each labeled with a "guard condition" depicted in square brackets.
- Guard conditions are simply Boolean expressions evaluated at runtime. If a guard condition evaluates to true, the corresponding transition is taken. Otherwise the transition is considered disabled, meaning that it is not taken.
- A special complementary guard depicted as "else" in square brackets evaluates to true only if all other guards from the same choice pseudo state evaluate to false.

#### Points to remember
- In summary, the choice pseudo state and guard conditions turn out to be simply IF-s and ELSEs in your C code.
- Please note that these are exactly the same IFs and ELSEs that the state machine was designed to eliminate in the first place i.e. "spaghetti code".
- So the moral here is that guard conditions should be used very judiciously. Too many of them, and we will be back in square one (spaghetti), where the guards effectively take over handling of all the relevant conditions in the system. 
- On the other hand, guards are sometimes unavoidable, because they add the necessary flexibility to the state machines.
- Therefore one of the main challenges in becoming an effective state machine designer is to develop a sense for which parts of the behavior should be captured in states and transitions at design time, and which parts require runtime flexibility of guard conditions. 
- Generally, you should challenge yourself to use as few guard conditions as possible.
